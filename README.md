This is a collection of projects I have made that I am particularly proud of and want to showcase.

|May 2024| [SchoolMeetings (Boka Läraren)](https://github.com/josephRashidMaalouf/SchoolMeetings/blob/master/README.md) | In my previous role as a teacher for grades 4-6, organizing parent-teacher meetings was one of my tasks. I’ve developed a web app that serves as a booking system, allowing teachers to post available time slots and parents to book appointments using a separate link. The tech stack includes Blazor, ASP.NET Core, Minimal API, Microsoft SQL Server, and MongoDB. | [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cs,html,css,bootstrap,dotnet,mongodb&perline=3&perline=1)](https://skillicons.dev)

### [MajornaGameStore](https://github.com/josephRashidMaalouf/MajornaGameStore)
<i>April 2024</i><br>
This project was made as a part of a group project at my vocational college. In this group project we (.NET developers) teamed up with software tester students, cloud developer students and IT-project manager students. The purpose of this project was for us to practice using SCRUM in order to produce a website for a fictional gaming store. We did two sprints during a 5-week period and this was the result. My main contribution to this project was writing the code for the backend layers, as well as the code needed to consume the API in the frontend.

## Static websites
### [3amos pizza](https://github.com/josephRashidMaalouf/3amospizza.github.io)
<i>February 2024</i><br>
This is just a simple static website made with html, css and vanilla js. I wouldn't count myself as a frontend developer, but I am still really happy with how this came out. I used bootstrap to make it responsive and mobile friendly, and sprinkled some of my own css to adjust the looks of the site to my own preferences. This is a website for a fictional pizzeria.

## MAUI
### [Joe Quiz Maker](https://github.com/josephRashidMaalouf/JoeQuizMaker)
<i>January 2024</i><br>
This is yet another a cross-platform app built with .NET MAUI, featuring a shell app architecture and implementing the MVVM design pattern. In this application I have used MongoDb for data storage, and MongoDb Driver as my ORM. The application is essentially a quiz maker that allows the user to write and play quizzes.

### [Z Home Library](https://github.com/josephRashidMaalouf/ZHomeLibrary)
<i>January 2024</i><br>
Z Home Library is a cross-platform app built with .NET MAUI, featuring a shell app architecture and implementing the MVVM design pattern. The purpose of this application is to let you manage your personal book collection at home, and help you keep track of to whom you have lended your books. This app is available for download on [Microsoft store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P2HBLR8DSHM?ocid=pdpshare).

## WPF
### [Bookstore manager](https://github.com/josephRashidMaalouf/BookstoreManager)
<i>December 2023</i><br>
This is one of my earliest projects. It is a database first application that uses Entity Framework as an ORM. The purpose of this application is to manage a fictional bookstore franchise.
